                In this study, I use cabbage white butterflies (<i>Pieris spp.</i>) as a model for solitary pollinators to investigate how the timing of 
                  <strong>Microbial Acquisition</strong> shapes <strong>Community Assembly</strong> dynamics over time.
                By combining molecular techniques, ecological modeling, and both quantitative and qualitative approaches, 
                  I can test hypotheses on host selection and <strong>Neutral Community Assembly</strong> in natural habitats.

These analyses will be accompanied by empirical tests within a butterfly rearing. <strong>Targeted Manipulations</strong> will help to distinguish among stochastic and deterministic processes, to reveal the impact of <strong>Priority Effects</strong> during microbial community assembly. Understanding these dynamics will provide insights into how anthropogenic influences can disturb microbiota assembly of wild pollinators.
