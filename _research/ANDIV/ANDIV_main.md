How to manipulate a plant microbiome under field conditions? In a time when microbiome analyses where still in their infancies, I aimed at an <i>in-planta</i> <b>microbiome manipulation</b> approach using transgenic plants. The goal was to establish a tool to test hypothesis on <b>microbiome function</b> within a plantsâ€™ natural habitat. Screenings of different antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) revealed a suitable candidate. But native endophytic bacteria showed a high heterogeneity in their susceptibility to the expressed peptide. This resulted in a resilient microbiome under field conditions. This underlines the importance of field research, as lab-based assays could not resolve the resilience of natural microbial communities.

<blockquote><q><i>In order to manipulate the microbiome, we used the expression of antimicrobial peptides. Our plants showed activity against different Bacillus species, which are mainly known as plant beneficial microbes. We assumed that that these transgenic plants might show deficits in growth or reproduction in field experiments. In other words: we wanted to make an unhappy plant to see how important microbes are for them. To our surprise, the plants appeared rather unimpressed when we compared them with controls in the field,</i></q> first author Arne Weinhold summarizes.
