    <h3>Solitary Pollinator Microbiota</h3>
     <div style="text-align: justify;">
           <p>
       My research focuses on <strong>Microbiota Assembly</strong> of <strong>Adult Butterflies</strong>. A specialized gut-microbiome is important for many pollinating insects, particular in the light of <strong>Pollinator Health</strong> and <strong>Insect Decline</strong>. While microbial associations have been extensively studied in social pollinators like honeybees, far less is known about <strong>Solitary Species</strong>, which must acquire their microbiota from <strong>Environmental Sources</strong>. Still, major drivers of microbiota assembly in wild pollinators remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, I investigate microbial accumulation dynamics in both <strong>European</strong> (see <a href="#Pieris">Pieris Project</a>) and <strong>Neotropical Butterfly</strong> species (see <a href="#ANDIV">ANDIV Project</a>).
