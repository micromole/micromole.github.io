    <h3>Butterfly Microbiota</h3>
           <p>
       My current research focus on the assembly of <strong>Adult Butterfly Microbiota</strong>. A specialized gut-microbiota is important for many pollinating insects, particular in the light of pollinator health and insect decline. But microbial associations have been mainly studied in social pollinators like the honeybee. In contrast, the majority of wild pollinators are solitary species and need to acquire their microbiota from environmental sources. Still, major drivers of microbiota assembly in wild pollinator are insufficiently understood. (see <a href="#ANDIV">ANDIV Project</a>) .
