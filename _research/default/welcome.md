       My main research focus is on <strong>Microbiome Assembly</strong> of <strong>Adult Butterflies</strong>. The assembly of a specialized gut-microbiota is important for many pollinating insects. But microbial associations of pollinators have been mainly studied in groups with socially maintained microbiota, particular honeybees and bumblebees. In contrast, the majority of wild pollinators are solitary species and need to acquire their microbiota from environmental sources. Still, major drivers of microbiota assembly in wild pollinator are insufficiently understood compared to social pollinators.

I use cabbage white butterflies (<i>Pieris sp.</i>) as a solitary pollinator model to understand environmental driver of gut microbiota assembly in the light of <strong>Pollinator Health</strong> and <strong>Insect Decline</strong>. Here, I am interested how the manipulation of the <strong>Acquisition</strong> timepoint of microbes drives community <strong>Assembly</strong> dynamics over a temporal gradient using quantitative and qualitative approaches.
The combination of molecular investigations and ecological modelling will allow to test hypothesis about host-selection and <strong>Neutral Community Assembly</strong> in natural habitats. This will be accompanied by empirical tests, to evaluate how a disturbance in microbial acquisition can influence the accumulation process.
