    <h3>Solitary Polinator Microbiota</h3>
           <p>
       My current research has the focus on <strong>Microbiota Assembly</strong> of <strong>Adult Butterflies</strong>. A specialized gut-microbiota is important for many pollinating insects, particular in the light of <strong>pollinator health</strong> and <strong>insect decline</strong>. But microbial associations have been mainly studied in social pollinators like the honeybee. In contrast, the majority of wild pollinators are solitary species and need to acquire their microbiota from environmental sources. Still, major drivers of microbiota assembly in wild pollinators are insufficiently understood. I investigate microbial accumulation dynamics in european butterflies (see <a href="#Pieris">Pieris Project</a>) as well as neotropical species (see <a href="#ANDIV">ANDIV Project</a>).
