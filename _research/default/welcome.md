    <h3>Solitary Pollinator Microbiota</h3>
     <div style="text-align: justify;">
           <p>
       My research focuses on <strong>Microbiota Assembly</strong> of <strong>Adult Butterflies</strong>. A specialized gut-microbiome is important for many pollinating insects, particular in the light of <strong>pollinator health</strong> and <strong>insect decline</strong>. While microbial associations have been extensively studied in social pollinators like honeybees, far less is known about solitary species, which must acquire their microbiota from environmental sources. Still, major drivers of microbiota assembly in wild pollinators remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, I investigate microbial accumulation dynamics in both European (see <a href="#Pieris">Pieris Project</a>) and Neotropical butterfly species (see <a href="#ANDIV">ANDIV Project</a>).
