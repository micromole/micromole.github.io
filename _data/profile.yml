  <p>
    I consider myself as <b><ins>Micro</ins>bial <ins>Mol</ins>ecular <ins>E</ins>cologist</b> (<code>mi¬∑cro¬∑mole</code>).
    I have been trained cross-disciplinary at the interfaces of molecular and organismic disciplines and combine ecological field work with quantitative microbiome analysis.
    My interest is on <strong>Microbiome Assembly of Butterflies</strong>.
   My broader research focus is on <strong>host-microbe symbiosis</strong> of <strong>solitary pollinators</strong> and
   microbial transmission among <strong>plant-pollinator networks</strong>.
   My goal is an integrative understanding of microbiomes in the light of macroecological concepts.
   </p>
  <p>
   Currently I am working at the <a href="https://www.cora.bio.lmu.de/">Center for Organismic Adaptation (CORA)</a> at LMU Munich.
   Before I have worked on <strong>Microbiome Function</strong> in plants and insects (see <a href="/projects">Past Projects <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></a>).
   </p> 
  <blockquote>
        <q>...what I consider is the key aspect of the future of education in the life sciences,
        a curriculum based on the ecology and evolution of the biosphere that integrates microbiology and macrobiology
        into a unified systems biology.</q>
