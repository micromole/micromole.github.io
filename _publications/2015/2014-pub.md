          We describe a fungal disease outbreak in a native N. attenuata population comprising 873 plants. Native fungal pathogens were isolated from diseased plants, characterized genetically, chemotaxonomically and morphologically, revealing several isolates of the ascomycete genera Fusarium and Alternaria.
