Plant roots associate with the diverse microbial community in soil and can establish mutualistic relationships with microbes. The genetic characterization of the plant microbiome (total microbiota of plants) has intensified, but we still lack experimental proof of the ecological function of the root microbiome. Experimental inoculations of seeds with native bacterial consortium during germination significantly attenuated plant mortality, demonstrating that a plantâ€™s opportunistic mutualistic associations with soil microbes have the potential to increase the resilience of crops.
