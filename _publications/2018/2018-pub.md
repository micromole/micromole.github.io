          In the recent years, there has been considerable interest to investigate the adaptive transgenerational plasticity of plants and how a “stress memory” can be transmitted to the following generation. Although, increasing evidence suggests that transgenerational adaptive responses have widespread ecological relevance, the underlying epigenetic processes have rarely been elucidated.
