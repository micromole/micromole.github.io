        <i>“Saying that plants need “healthy soil” has a deeper meaning than we had been aware of until now. It simply means that a balanced microbial soil community is vital for plants to grow and remain healthy. So far, only individual bacterial strains had been applied in agriculture. However, bacteria do not live alone, they form communities which complement each other. Only when they interact with each other they can exert their positive effects on plant health.”</i> says Arne Weinhold
