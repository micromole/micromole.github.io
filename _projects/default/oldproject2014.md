     Majority of my phd work I investigated if the plant associated bacterial community can be manipulated using heterologous expression of antimicrobial peptides.
The goal was to test hypothesis in the field and directly manipulate the plant microbiome in nature. During a time when microbiome analysis where still in their infancies, this project aimed in in-planta manipulation.

        For a tidy layout, it is recommended to set the width of the cards to be either multiple of 3 or multiple of 4 for all cards, except for small badges that do not take up much space (width=1).
