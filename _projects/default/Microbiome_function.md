    <h3>Microbiome Function</h3>
        <p>
       My research has primarily focused on <strong>Microbiome Function</strong> in plants and insects. Here, I used manipulative approaches and molecular tools to answer ecological questions. By rearing insects under gnotobiotic conditions or utilizing transgenic plants, I have explored the consequences of microbiome disturbances in both laboratory and field settings.  </p>

          <h4>Functional Ecology of the Butterfly Microbiota</h4>
            When joining the Collaborative Research Centre (<a href="https://www.sfb973.de/" target="_blank">CRC 973</a>) at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, I moved my focus to the next trophic level on <strong>insect-microbe-symbiosis</strong>. In a joint project with Wageningen University (<a href="https://www.wur.nl/en.htm" target="_blank">WUR</a>), I quantified egg-associated bacteria of <i>Pieris brassicae</i> and tested their influence on plant defense priming. Our research revealed that the manipulation of the <strong>adult butterfly microbiota</strong> influences offspring performance. Such a <i>trans-generational</i> effect was unexpected but highlights the ecological significance of microbial acquisition in natural environments. </p>

          <h4>Plant Microbiome Function</h4>
            During my time at the <a href=" https://www.ice.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology</a>, my research focused on <strong>plant-microbe-herbivore</strong> interactions. Through multiple field trips to the Great Basin Desert in Utah (USA), I gained extensive experience in ecological fieldwork. This interdisciplinary mix of molecular, ecological and analytical work was a comprehensive training in natural sciences outside the boundaries of scientific disciplines.   </p>
