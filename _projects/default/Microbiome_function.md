    <h3>Microbiome Function</h3>
        <p>
       My work at the <a href=" https://www.ice.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology</a> had the focus on <b>plant-microbe</b> and <b>plant-herbivore</b> interactions.
          I used genetically modified plants expressing antimicrobial peptides to test <b>microbiome function</b> in nature.
          <h4>Functional Ecology of the Butterfly Microbiota</h4>
          Here, I gained a lot of experience in <b>ecological field work</b> during several field trips into the <b>Great Basin Desert of Utah (USA)</b>.
          I have learned how powerful it can be to apply <b>molecular tools</b> on <b>ecological questions</b>.
          <h4>Plant Microbiome Function</h4>
          This interdisciplinary mix of molecular, ecological and analytical work was a comprehensive training in natural sciences outside the boundaries of scientific disciplines.
          My graduate research training was funded by the <b>International Leibniz Research School for Microbial and Biomolecular Interactions</b> (<a href="https://www.ilrs.de/" target="_blank">ILRS</a>), which is part of the <b>Jena School for Microbial Communication</b> (<a href="https://www.jsmc-phd.de/" target="_blank">JSMC</a>).
