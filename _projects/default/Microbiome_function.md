    <h3>Microbiome Function</h3>
        <p>
       My past research primarily focused on <strong>Microbiome Function</strong> in plants and insects. Here, I used manipulative approaches and molecular tools to explore consequences of microbiome disturbances in both laboratory and field settings.  </p>

          <h4>Functional Ecology of the Butterfly Microbiota</h4>
            When joining the <strong>Collaborative Research Centre</strong> (CRC 973) at <strong>Freie Universit√§t Berlin</strong>, I moved my research to the next trophic level on <strong>Insect-Microbe-Symbiosis</strong>. I focused on quantitative microbiome analysis. We tested the influence of egg-associated bacteria of <i>Pieris brassicae</i> on plant defense priming. Our research revealed that the manipulation of the <strong>adult butterfly microbiota</strong> influences offspring performance. Such a <i>trans-generational</i> effect was unexpected but highlights the ecological significance of microbial acquisition in natural environments. </p>

          <h4>Plant Microbiome Function</h4>
            During my time at the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology</strong>, I investigated <strong>Plant-Microbe-Herbivore</strong> interactions. Through multiple field trips to the Great Basin Desert in Utah (USA), I gained extensive experience in ecological fieldwork. This interdisciplinary mix of molecular, ecological and analytical work was a comprehensive training in natural sciences outside the boundaries of scientific disciplines.   </p>
