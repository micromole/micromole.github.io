    <h3>Microbiome Function</h3> <div style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>
       My past research explored the functional roles of microbiomes in plants and insects. I used experimental manipulations and molecular tools to understand the impact of microbiome disturbances in both laboratory and field settings.  </p>

          <h4>Functional Ecology of the Butterfly Microbiota</h4> <div style="text-align: justify;">
           At <strong>Freie Universit√§t Berlin</strong>, I used quantitative approaches to study the egg-associated microbiota of <i>Pieris brassicae</i>. We manipulated the adult butterfly microbiota to investigate their influence on plant defense priming and found an parental effect on offspring performance (see <a href="#Parental-Legacy">Parental Legacy</a> story). Such a <i>trans-generational</i> influence was unexpected but highlights the ecological significance of microbial acquisition of adult butterflies in natural environments.  </p>

          <h4>Plant Microbiome Function</h4> <div style="text-align: justify;">
            During my time at the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology</strong>, I studied <strong>Plant-Microbe-Herbivore</strong> interactions in natural context. Through multiple field trips to the Great Basin Desert in Utah (USA), I gained extensive experience in ecological fieldwork. My research included transgenic approaches for <i>in planta</i> microbiome manipulation (see <a href="#Resilient-Microbiome">Resilient Microbiome</a> story) and the application of synthetic microbial communities for biocontrol (see <a href="#SynCom">SynCom</a> story). This interdisciplinary mix of molecular, ecological and analytical work provided a comprehensive training in natural sciences outside the boundaries of scientific disciplines.  </p> <div>
