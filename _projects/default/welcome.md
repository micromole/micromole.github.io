        My work at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology had the focus on plant-microbe and plant-herbivore interactions. I used genetically modified plants expressing antimicrobial peptides to test microbiome function in nature. Here, I gained a lot of experience in ecological field work during several field trips into the Great Basin Desert of Utah (USA). I have learned how powerful it can be to apply molecular tools on ecological questions. This interdisciplinary mix of molecular, ecological and analytical work was a comprehensive training in natural sciences outside the boundaries of scientific disciplines.
