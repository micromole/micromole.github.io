    <h3>Microbiome Function</h3>
        <p>
       My past research primarily focused on <strong>Microbiome Function</strong> of plants and insects. Here, I used manipulative approaches and molecular tools to explore consequences of microbiome disturbances in both laboratory and field settings.  </p>

          <h4>Functional Ecology of the Butterfly Microbiota</h4>
            When joining the <strong>Collaborative Research Centre</strong> (CRC 973) at <strong>Freie Universit√§t Berlin</strong>, I moved my research to the next trophic level on <strong>Insect-Microbe-Symbiosis</strong>. I used quantitative approaches to investigate the egg-associated microbiota of <i>Pieris brassicae</i>. We manipulated the parental microbiota to investigate their influence on plant defense priming, but found an influence on offspring performance (see <a href="#Parental-Legacy">Parental Legacy</a> story). Such a <i>trans-generational</i> effect was unexpected but highlights the ecological significance of microbial acquisition of adult butterflies in natural environments.  </p>

          <h4>Plant Microbiome Function</h4>
            During my time at the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology</strong>, I worked on <strong>Plant-Microbe-Herbivore</strong> interactions. Through multiple field trips to the Great Basin Desert in Utah (USA), I gained extensive experience in ecological fieldwork. I used a transgenic approach for <i>in planta</i> microbiome manipulation (see <a href="#Resilient-Microbiome">Resilient Microbiome</a> story) and synthetic communities for biocontrol (see <a href="#SynCom">SynCom</a> story). This interdisciplinary mix of molecular, ecological and analytical work was a comprehensive training in natural sciences outside the boundaries of scientific disciplines.  </p>
