       My work at the <a href=" https://www.ice.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology</a> had the focus on <b>plant-microbe</b> and <b>plant-herbivore</b> interactions. I used genetically modified plants expressing antimicrobial peptides to test <b>microbiome function</b> in nature. Here, I gained a lot of experience in <b>ecological field work</b> during several field trips into the <b>Great Basin Desert of Utah (USA)</b>. I have learned how powerful it can be to apply <b>molecular tools</b> on <b>ecological questions</b>. This interdisciplinary mix of molecular, ecological and analytical work was a comprehensive training in natural sciences outside the boundaries of scientific disciplines. My graduate research training was funded by the <b>International Leibniz Research School for Microbial and Biomolecular Interactions</b> (<a href="https://www.ilrs.de/" target="_blank">ILRS</a>), which is part of the <b>Jena School for Microbial Communication</b> (<a href="https://www.jsmc-phd.de/" target="_blank">JSMC</a>).
