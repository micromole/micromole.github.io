     One of our larger field trials with more than 735 plants tested the application of a <b>SynCom</b> (<b>synthetic bacterial community</b>) as <b>biocontrol agent</b>. The continues cropping of <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> on the research field plot resulted in the buildup of soil borne pathogens, similar as observed in agricultural fields. Plants were suddenly dying and showed black root symptoms. We tested different strategies including <b>fungicide application</b> and <b>soil amendment</b> using <b>biochar</b>. This appeared as a logical approach as young tobacco plants germinate after wildfires on burned soil. But none of these applications helped. </p>
        <p>
     The best reduction in plant mortality could be achieved via inoculation with a <b>SynCom</b> of five bacterial strains. Individual inoculations where not as effective, but the combination of all strains showed synergistic effects. These experiments highlight the importance of an early establishment of a microbial partnership with plants.
