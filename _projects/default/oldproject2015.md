     During my postdoc phase at the MPI for chemical ecology, we performed a large field trial and applied an artificial <b>bacterial community</b> as a <b>biocontrol agent</b>. The continues cropping of <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> on our field plot resulted in buildup of a wilt disease, similar as observed in agricultural fields. Plants were suddenly dying and showed black root symptoms. We tested different strategies including <b>fungicide application</b> and <b>soil amendment</b> using <b>biochar</b>. This seems to be the most logical approach as young tobacco plants germinate after wildfires on burned soil. But none of these applications seems to help. </p>
        <p>
     The most efficient reduction in disease symptoms could be achieved via inoculation with a <b>synthetic bacterial community</b>. Inoculations with individual strains where less effective, but the combination of all five bacterial strains had synergistic effects. These experiments showed how important the early establishment of a microbial partnership is for plants. It also emphasized the importance of crop rotation to prevent the buildup of soil borne pathogens.
