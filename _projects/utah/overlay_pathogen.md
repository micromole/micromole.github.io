    <p class="card-text">
      A dynamic disease outbreak within a native population of <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> plants was a unique opportunity to study pathogen dynamics in the wild. We isolated several fungi to establish a native pathovar system for laboratory screenings. These strains has been since used in several different projects by other researchers.
